      <p>
        My name is Ryeley Kuykendall and I am a student in the ITC 209 and ITC 201 programs at The Sage Colleges. While attending classes at The Sage Colleges I also work as a Network Systems Technician. My day to day operations include maintaing and upgrading
        share drives for the college, building and maintaining our Virtual Desktop environment via VMWare Horizon, developing the system images for the desktop machines in use by the members of the college, and much much more.
      </p>

        My fascination with technology began when I was a child, I had always had an interest in technology, video games, gadgets, phones etc. It wasn't until a 2007 that the fascination turned into a fullblown obsession. I purchased my first iPod Touch and began
        experimenting with Jailbreaking and customizations that went along with it. That eventually evolved into building and designing gaming desktops. I learned a lot from YouTube, almost everything I would say. Specifically one YouTube channel by the
        name of LinusTechTips. I have included one of the videos I used to watch below. </p>
      </br>

      </div>

      <p>
        I would spend countless hours rewatching the channles videos making sure I memorized every single aspect that was involved in building a desktop. It paid off, I was able to turn that passion into a paying hobby. I occasionally build gaming and non-gaming
        desktops for people based on their budget. </p>
      <p>
        When I started working for The Sage Colleges my obsession only worsened. I became infatuated with enterprise grade hardware and learning absolutely EVERYTHING I could in regards to setting up an enterprise environment at home. I purchased a large amount
        of prosume quality equipment and began building my homelab.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can check out all of the servers I have at home over at the <a href="homelab.html">Homelab</a> tab. I have a small excerpt from my main website <a href="http://www.kirkenjerk.us" target="_blank">Kirkenjerk.us</a> as well to give you a taste
        of what I use that site for. The website is hosted on one of the servers at my house.
      </p>
      <p>What do I have planned next? Well I was recently engaged over the 2017 summer, so I am currently plannign for my wedding.</p>

        <p>Subsequently, I am continuing on with my education and hope to take 2 more classes durign the Spring 2018 semester. I am trying to focus on work, and absorb as much information that I can from my corworkers and supervisor. It is because of this
          that my homelab is taking a backburner for a bit. You need not worry, as I am sure once an affordable 10G switch is released it will reignite my passion for homelabbing. I will be very adamant about upgrading every device with a 10G nic.

      Not realted to technology is my love of music, recently I have been doing my best to expand my music tastes. I have become a huge fan of the band Vulfpeck and have fallen in love with the song "1612" which you can listen to below!
